## Introduction

Energy harvesting has been used for decades for bicycle dynamos or solar panels. But the technology is living a revolution today with staggering applications areas, such as building and industry automation, smart cities, automotive vehicles, security systems…

How about generating energy while having fun? Team engie-hub was asked by Engie Belgium to explore this question.

Our answer: "With the help of a dashboard, an energy generating floor and a particle photon we simplify the concept of energy creation and usage. By combining gamification with insights and goals we’re turning energy awareness and generation into a fun experience."
